# Elusiv - Add on-chain privacy to your dApp with just a few lines of code.

If you have any questions about this SDK, check out the [docs](https://elusiv-privacy.github.io/elusiv-sdk/) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/elusivprivacy) to get help. If you want to learn more about the core protocol, check out our [core docs](https://docs.elusiv.io). 

## Quick Setup

### 1. Install

```shell
npm i @elusiv/sdk
```

### (1.5 Optional)

Ensure `process.browser` is set if you're using this sdk in a frontend environment. Depending on your environment, this might require a polyfill. You can verify this by trying to run `console.log(process.browser)` within your top-level app and ensuring it returns a truthy value.

### 2. Basic Usage

```ts
// We sign using an external library here because there is no wallet connected. Usually you'd use the solana wallet adapter instead.
import { sign } from '@noble/ed25519';
import { Connection, Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';
import { Elusiv, SEED_MESSAGE } from '@elusiv/sdk';


const userKp = Keypair.generate();

// Generate the input seed. Remember, this is almost as important as the private key, so don't log this!
// (Slice because in Solana's keypair type the first 32 bytes is the privkey and the last 32 is the pubkey)
const seed = await sign(
    Buffer.from(SEED_MESSAGE, 'utf-8'),
    userKp.secretKey.slice(0, 32),
);

// Create the elusiv instance
const elusiv = await Elusiv.getElusivInstance(seed, userKp.publicKey, new Connection('https://api.devnet.solana.com'), 'devnet');

// Top up our private balance with 1 SOL (= 1_000_000_000 Lamports)
const topupTxData = await elusiv.buildTopUpTx(LAMPORTS_PER_SOL, 'LAMPORTS');
// Sign it (only needed for topups, as we're topping up from our public key there)
topupTx.tx.partialSign(keyPair);
// Send it off
const topupSig = await elusiv.sendElusivTx(topupTxData);

// Send half a SOL, privately ðŸ˜Ž
const recipient = Keypair.generate().publicKey;
const sendTx = await elusiv.buildSendTx(0.5 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL, recipient, 'LAMPORTS');
// No need to sign as we prove ownership of the private funds using a zero knowledge proof
const sendSig = await elusiv.sendElusivTx(sendTx);

console.log(`Performed topup with sig ${topupSig.signature} and send with sig ${sendSig.signature}`);
```

If you get the error `etc.sha512Sync` not set, change the following code in the above sample:

```ts 
import * as ed, { sign } from '@noble/ed25519'
import { sha512 } from '@noble/hashes/sha512'
ed.etc.sha512Sync = (...m) => sha512(ed.etc.concatBytes(...m))
```

### More advanced usage

The main flow to make a DeFi action private that takes asset `A` as an input and produces asset `B` as an output (for example a swap) generally goes:

0. (Assume the user has a private balance already. If not, give them an option to create one.)
1. Derive a determinstic one-time burner keypair `K` using [deriveKeyExternal](https://elusiv-privacy.github.io/elusiv-sdk/classes/Elusiv.html#deriveKeyExternal)
2. Perform private send to `K` for asset `A`
3. Perform DeFi operation that takes in `A` and returns `B` using `K` (e.g. swapping token `A` for token `B`)
4. Topup `B` to private balance
